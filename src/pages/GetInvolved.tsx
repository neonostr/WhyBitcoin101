                  Every small action matters.
                  When you share great educational content, help answer questions on Nostr,
                  or add your own ideas and resources, it becomes a piece of the bigger
                  picture.
                  On Nostr these pieces connect. They spread, get repeated, improved, and
                  remembered. What starts as one spark from you can echo into a lasting
                  signal for others.
                  WhyBitcoin101 is part of this flow too. Not above, not separate - just
                  another tool, another hand carrying the message. It gathers what we
                  together create and places it where more people can find it.
                  Together we build a library of clear answers. A place to point the next
                  curious mind - a living orange pill that keeps evolving, gathering sparks
                  of change, one curious mind at a time.
