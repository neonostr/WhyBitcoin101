Understanding Bitcoin doesn't have to be complicated. Let's start with the fundamentals.

What is Bitcoin? - Bitcoin is money owned by the people that operates without a central authority. It's money that is truly yours, can't be manipulated, and can be sent directly to anyone in the world.

How Does It Work? - Bitcoin securely records all transactions in a public record book distributed globally. A unique system ensures the record can't be altered, eliminating the need for banks or other intermediaries.

Why Is It Special? - Built by the people, free from control, Bitcoin is the world's most scarce asset. Limited to 21 million, it's designed to be perfect money - a secure store of your time and energy.

Bitcoin is for Everyone - Just as one U.S. Dollar equals 100 cents, one Bitcoin equals 100 million satoshis. This divisibility means you can get involved with Bitcoin starting with any amount - even $1.`;
